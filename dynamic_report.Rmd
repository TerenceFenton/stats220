### ASSESSMENT OF MONSTER ENERGY RANGE ACROSS AUCKLAND NZ



The following is the average number of options available at each location type that sold Monster Energy.

```{r}
# Number of Options per Location Type:

# Setup Averages for Number of Options:
average_quantity_dc <- filter(latest_data, location_Category == "Dairy / Convenience Store")
dc_mean <- mean(average_quantity_dc$quantity, na.rm = TRUE)

average_quantity_sg <- filter(latest_data, location_Category == "Supermarket / Grocer")
sg_mean <- mean(average_quantity_sg$quantity, na.rm = TRUE)

average_quantity_ff <- filter(latest_data, location_Category == "Fast Food")
ff_mean <- mean(average_quantity_ff$quantity, na.rm = TRUE)

average_quantity_ce <- filter(latest_data, location_Category == "Café / Eat-in")
ce_mean <- mean(average_quantity_ce$quantity, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create New Dataframe:
average_means_quantity <- c(dc_mean, sg_mean, ff_mean, ce_mean)
lc_vector <- c("Dairy / Convenience Store", "Supermarket / Grocer", "Fast Food", "Café / Eat-in")
new_lc_q <- tibble(location_Category = lc_vector,
                   quantity = average_means_quantity)

# Setup Overall Mean:
mean_quantity = round(mean(latest_data$quantity, na.rm = TRUE))

# Present Data:
ggplot(data = new_lc_q) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = location_Category, y = quantity),
           stat = "identity",
           na.rm = TRUE) + 
  labs(title = "Average Number of Monster Energy options at observed locations",
       x = "Location Types",
       y = "Average Number of Options")


```

Of all surveyed locations that sold Monster Energy, there was on average `r mean_quantity` options available.

### ASSESSMENT OF MONSTER ENERGY PRICE ACROSS AUCKLAND NZ


The following is the average median price of Monster at each location type that sold Monster Energy.

```{r}
# Price per Location type:

# Calculate Average median Prices:
dc_price_mean <- round(mean(average_quantity_dc$price, na.rm = TRUE), 2)

sg_price_mean <- round(mean(average_quantity_sg$price, na.rm = TRUE), 2)

ff_price_mean <- round(mean(average_quantity_ff$price, na.rm = TRUE), 2)

ce_price_mean <- round(mean(average_quantity_ce$price, na.rm = TRUE), 2)

# Create New Dataframe:
average_means_price <- c(dc_price_mean, sg_price_mean, ff_price_mean, ce_price_mean)
new_lc_p <- tibble(location_Category = lc_vector,
                   price = average_means_price)

# Setup Overall Mean:
mean_price = round(mean(latest_data$price, na.rm = TRUE),2)

# Present Data:
ggplot(data = new_lc_p) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = location_Category, y = price),
           stat = "identity",
           na.rm = TRUE) + 
  labs(title = "Summed median Price of Monster at Monster Energy Locations",
       x = "Location Types",
       y = "median price")

```

Of all surveyed locations that sold Monster Energy, the average price of Monster Energy when not accounting for location type was $`r mean_price`
