# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in a Specialization of Data Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because first off, I need it for my degree and secondly, I really enjoy statistics as a profession and want to enhance my skillset.
- I am interested in learning more about the world
